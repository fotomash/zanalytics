üìä Understanding VIX and DXY
VIX (Volatility Index): Often termed the "fear gauge," the VIX measures the market's expectation of volatility over the next 30 days based on S&P 500 index options. A rising VIX indicates increased market fear and anticipated volatility, while a declining VIX suggests complacency and stability.

DXY (US Dollar Index): The DXY reflects the value of the US dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. An increasing DXY suggests a stronger dollar, often associated with risk-off sentiment, whereas a decreasing DXY indicates a weaker dollar, typically linked to risk-on sentiment.

High VIX & Rising DXY: Signals heightened fear and a flight to safety, suggesting potential downward pressure on risk assets like equities.
Low VIX & Falling DXY: Indicates market complacency and a preference for risk, potentially supporting upward trends in equities.
Divergence Between VIX and DXY: May point to underlying market tensions or transitions, warranting closer analysis of other indicators and market conditions.
üõ†Ô∏è Practical Application in Trading
To effectively incorporate VIX and DXY into your trading decisions:
Monitor Key Levels: Identify historical thresholds for both indices that have previously signaled market turning points.

And what would be the best option for pulling the data? Can I pull it off from the 12th data, or can I pull it off from the FinHAB? I've got API keys for both, but I'm using the free tier.
ChatGPT said:
If you're on the free tier of both 12th Data and FinHAB, the better option depends on the specific constraints of what you‚Äôre trying to access:
12th Data is usually more straightforward for macro snapshot feeds like DXY, US10Y, Bunds, and VIX if your goal is just to fetch daily or intraday levels. It's API-friendly with simple endpoints, often formatted for trading logic. The free tier generally supports real-time or slightly delayed indices, which is good enough for intermarket sentiment mapping.
FinHAB, on the other hand, tends to be more research-oriented. If your API keys there are for fundamentals or news-based sentiment scoring, it‚Äôs better for longer-horizon macro overlays‚Äînot rapid snapshot use. Also, their free tier often has tighter call limits and longer cache intervals.
So short version? If you just want to pull the latest DXY, VIX, yields, etc., for sentiment alignment: go with 12th Data. It‚Äôll give you what you need with less lag and better formatting for quant-style integration.
Do you have a specific script or endpoint in mind that you're calling with either one? I can help tailor the API call if you want.

Twelvedata and finnhub is what I was saying 
ChatGPT said:
Both Twelve Data and Finnhub offer APIs suitable for intermarket sentiment snapshots (DXY, US10Y, Bunds, VIX), but with important considerations for free-tier usage:
üß© Twelve Data
Strengths:
Broad coverage including forex, indices, crypto, and some macro indicators.
Simple JSON API.
Limitations:
Free tier usually has 8 requests/min and 800/day.
Limited access to macroeconomic or yield curve data (US10Y/Bunds may not be covered unless explicitly stated).
VIX data sometimes not included on free tier.
üß© Finnhub
Strengths:
Explicitly supports macroeconomic and bond yield endpoints (e.g., US10Y).
Covers indices like DXY and VIX.
Higher free-tier flexibility: 60 API calls/min, 30,000/month.
Limitations:
Coverage for Bunds may depend on their bond dataset or require symbol mapping.
‚úÖ Recommendation
Use Finnhub for a full intermarket macro snapshot, especially if you want reliable access to:
US10Y yield
VIX
DXY via FX proxies (e.g., USD/EUR or their currency index if offered)
If you only need price action on DXY and VIX, and you‚Äôre doing light querying, Twelve Data may suffice.
Let me know which one you want integrated for auto-snapshot, and I can draft the API call structure.

How to get then the data from finnhub - vix and dxy ? 
ChatGPT said:
To retrieve VIX and DXY data from Finnhub, you can use their indices and forex endpoints. Here's how to do it using HTTP requests with your API key:
üîπ 1. Get VIX (Volatility Index)
The symbol for VIX on Finnhub is typically "^VIX".
Endpoint:
GET https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=^VIX&token=YOUR_API_KEY
Example (using curl):
curl "https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=^VIX&token=YOUR_API_KEY"
Response Format:
{
  "c": 14.85,     // Current price
  "h": 15.21,     // High price of the day
  "l": 14.21,     // Low price of the day
  "o": 14.88,     // Open price of the day
  "pc": 14.97     // Previous close price
}
üîπ 2. Get DXY (US Dollar Index)
Finnhub may not offer a direct DXY ticker. Instead:
Use forex pair proxies, such as USD/EUR, USD/JPY, USD/CHF, etc.
Alternatively, approximate DXY sentiment by synthesizing those.
Example - USD/EUR:
curl "https://finnhub.io/api/v1/forex/rates?base=USD&token=YOUR_API_KEY"
Returns:
{
  "base": "USD",
  "quote": {
    "EUR": 0.9254,
    "JPY": 157.43,
    "CHF": 0.891,
    ...
  }
}
üß† Pro Tip:
To approximate DXY movement, monitor:
EUR/USD (inverse direction of DXY)
USD/JPY
GBP/USD (inverse)
USD/CHF
If USD strengthens across all ‚Üí DXY is likely rising.
Would you like a Python script that fetches both VIX and a DXY proxy using Finnhub?

Great ‚Äî here‚Äôs a simple Python script that uses your Finnhub API key to fetch VIX and approximate DXY sentiment via key forex pairs:
üêç Python Script: VIX & DXY Proxy from Finnhub
import requests

API_KEY = "d07lgo1r01qrslhp3q3gd07lgo1r01qrslhp3q40"

def get_vix():
    url = f"https://finnhub.io/api/v1/quote?symbol=^VIX&token={API_KEY}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    data = response.json()
    print("üìä VIX Snapshot")
    print(f"Current: {data['c']}, High: {data['h']}, Low: {data['l']}, Open: {data['o']}, Prev Close: {data['pc']}\n")

def get_dxy_proxy():
    url = f"https://finnhub.io/api/v1/forex/rates?base=USD&token={API_KEY}"
    response = requests.get(url)
    rates = response.json()["quote"]
    print("üìä DXY Proxy via Major Pairs:")
    print(f"USD/EUR: {rates['EUR']}")
    print(f"USD/JPY: {rates['JPY']}")
    print(f"USD/CHF: {rates['CHF']}")
    print(f"USD/GBP: {rates['GBP']}")
    print(f"USD/CAD: {rates['CAD']}\n")

get_vix()
get_dxy_proxy()
üí° What This Does:
Fetches current VIX levels.
Uses USD-based forex pairs to estimate DXY sentiment.
Stronger USD ‚Üí Lower EUR/USD, higher USD/JPY/CHF/CAD
Let me know if you'd like this expanded to include US10Y yields or chart output.
You said:
Ok, so is the US10Y also free 
ChatGPT said:
Yes ‚Äî US10Y (10-Year Treasury Yield) data is available for free on Finnhub using their economic data endpoint.
‚úÖ Endpoint for US10Y Yield
Use this symbol: "US10Y"
Request:
GET https://finnhub.io/api/v1/economic?symbol=US10Y&token=YOUR_API_KEY
Example with your API key:
curl "https://finnhub.io/api/v1/economic?symbol=US10Y&token=d07lgo1r01qrslhp3q3gd07lgo1r01qrslhp3q40"
Response Format:
{
  "symbol": "US10Y",
  "country": "US",
  "category": "Bonds",
  "indicator": "10 Year Treasury",
  "unit": "%",
  "value": 4.24,
  "datetime": "2025-06-24"
}
üß† Usage Tip
You can combine this with VIX and DXY snapshot data in your macro sentiment script to form a live macro conviction score as per the macro_presentation.md flow.
