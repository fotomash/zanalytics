# Zanalytics Phase 5 - Organic Intelligence

This phase introduces a standardized command schema and proactive strategy scheduling for autonomous agents. The directory provides placeholder modules for future expansion along with a sample strategy manifest.

## Structure

- `core/` – agent logic, commands, and dispatcher placeholders
- `knowledge/` – strategy definitions and manifests
- `monitoring/` – trigger configuration
- `api/` – API endpoint stubs
- `tests/` – test suite hooks
- `documentation/` – additional documentation

The `command_schema.json` defines a consistent format for inter-agent commands, while `London_Killzone_SMC.yml` demonstrates a time-based trading strategy with detailed workflow steps.
