# Zanalytics Phase 4 - Advanced Features Implementation

## Overview

Phase 4 completes the Zanalytics transformation with advanced features including:
- Performance monitoring and optimization
- Multi-level caching system
- Query optimization
- Advanced analytics with machine learning
- Production-ready deployment

## Components

### 1. Performance Monitoring (`monitoring/performance_monitor.py`)

Tracks system performance metrics:
- Execution time tracking
- Resource utilization monitoring
- Performance metric aggregation
- Automatic performance logging

**Usage:**
```python
from monitoring.performance_monitor import PerformanceMonitor, TimedOperation

monitor = PerformanceMonitor()

# Manual timing
monitor.start_timer("data_processing")
# ... do work ...
elapsed = monitor.end_timer("data_processing", component="etl")

# Context manager
with TimedOperation(monitor, "analysis", component="ml"):
    # ... perform analysis ...
    pass

# System metrics
monitor.record_system_snapshot()

# Get summary
summary = monitor.get_performance_summary(component="ml")
```

### 2. Caching System (`caching/`)

Implements a multi-level caching layer to improve data retrieval speed and reduce database load.

### 3. Optimization Utilities (`optimization/`)

Contains tools for query optimization and profiling to ensure efficient resource usage.

### 4. Deployment Configuration (`deployment/production_config.py`)

Provides production-ready settings including database connections, security keys, and logging configuration.

### 5. Requirements (`requirements.txt`)

Lists pinned package versions for deterministic builds and deployment.

## Usage

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Configure environment variables as needed for your deployment.
3. Import `ProductionConfig` in your application to access production settings.
